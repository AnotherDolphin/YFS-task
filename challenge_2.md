# Challenge_2
## Browser test cases

1. Address bar only accepts proper URL formats - validate input with RegEx in real time
2. Improper URL formats are automatically taken as a search string instead
3. Create a visual differentiation on the address bar between SSL certified sites (https) and insecure (http) sites - warn users about insecure sites before resource download
4. Does the page load and look like other common browsers?
5. How long does the page take to load, how does that compare to existing browsers?
6. Do scroll/swap, click/touch, enlarge/zoom functions timely respond to user input?
7. Follow proper CORS rules when attemting external api calls
8. Comprehensive inspection tools can be hard to introduce in a new browser MVP, but the prioty should be to include functioning js console
9. History, bookmarking and tabs are the core UX features to introduce first to make the browser usable
10. Instant Feedback option is critical at an early stage to assess overlooked usability bugs/issues
